Below is a **text-based visualization** of the concept map for improving the livelihood of people with disabilities. This structure highlights connections between key themes and subtopics. If you were to draw this visually, it would resemble a network of interconnected nodes (like a mind map).

### **Cross-Cutting Principles**  
*(Surrounding the entire map as foundational values)*  
- **Co-Design**: Involve people with disabilities in decision-making.  
- **Equity**: Address intersectionality (gender, race, poverty).  
- **Sustainability**: Long-term funding and policy commitment.  

---

### **Visual Mapping Tips**  
1. Use **colors/shapes** to differentiate themes (e.g., green for infrastructure, red for policy).  
2. Draw **arrows** to show interdependencies (e.g., policy â†’ infrastructure â†’ employment).  
3. Place **cross-cutting principles** as a border or overlay.  
4. Add **icons** (e.g., wheelchair, dollar sign, brain) for quick recognition.
